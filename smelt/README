Smelt
-----

  Smelt is an XML templating system that precompiles input documents to SML
code, allowing template processing invocations to be properly typechecked.
The generated code preserializes as much of the XML document tree as possible;
thus, its complexity depends only on the portions being substituted, with all
static content already flattened to plain text. The XML-embedded template is
heavily inspired by Kid and Genshi, two similar tools for Python, but trimmed
down and with some SML-specific features.

  Input documents are parsed as XML. They must have a processing instruction,
before the document element, of the form:

  <?template StructureName input bindings ?>

  The compiled template code will be a declaration of a structure, with the
specified name, containing only a function "render":

  structure StructureName = struct
    val render: input bindings -> Web.HTML
  end

  Note that the input bindings are substituted into a function declaration, of
the form "fun render ... = (expression)", so tuples must be parenthesized, and
curried functions can be declared.

  Within the document, two types of processing can be specified. Tree-level
manipulation can be defined with t:... attributes on elements; additionally,
within attribute values and text nodes, ${expressions} can be embedded to
directly insert string content. The compiled code XML-escapes all ${}
substitutions. To insert snippets of prerendered HTML, use $H{expr}; this
inserts a "Web.html" value literally into the output, with no further
processing.

  Any attribute beginning with "t:" must be a valid template attribute. (Smelt
is not yet namespace-aware, so this is not a namespace as such.) The following
attributes are defined:

- t:if="expr" (expr: bool)

    Only include the tagged element and its children if "expr" is true.

    Example: <p t:if="2 + 2 <> 4">Math is broken!</p>

- t:ifOption="expr as binding" (expr: 'a option)

    Only include the element and its children if "expr" evaluates to SOME 'a.
  The binding is used in a pattern-match, "case expr of SOME binding => ...";
  within child nodes, all bound variables will be available.
    If no " as " is present in the parameter value, the while string will be
  used for both expr and binding: "case s of SOME s => ...". 

    Example: <p t:ifOption="#username session as name">Hello, ${name}!</p>

- t:for="binding in expr" (expr: 'a list)

    Substitute this node and all its children repeated for each value in expr,
  with binding matched to each element in turn.

    Example: <ul><li t:for="i in items">${i}</li></ul>

- t:case="expr", t:of="binding"

    These two must be used together; a t:case element contains a number of
  child elements, each of which must contain a t:of attribute. Any text nodes
  that are immediate children of a t:case will be ignored if they contain only
  whitespace; it is an error if non-whitespace characters are found. They map
  as expected to a case/of expression.

    Example: <div t:case="cmp"><p t:of="GREATER">Greater</p> ... </div>

  For compatibility with XML's unordered attribtes, t: attributes are always
processed in the following order ("outer" to "inner"), rather than in the order
in which they appear in the program's source.

  t:of, t:for, t:ifOption, t:if, t:case

  See "example.html" for some sample template code.
