This is a wrapper for accessing MySQL from SML/NJ or MLton. It uses ML-NLFFI
to load the libmysqlclient dynamic library, and then wraps most libmysqlclient
functions as directly as possible.

Some notes:

- Although the details of the FFI are not exposed outside of the MySQLClient
  structure, it is not entirely safe. Specifically, accessing a result after
  its connection has been freed will cause undefined behavior (in the C sense),
  and failing to call free_result or close results in memory leaks. In most
  cases, another layer of wrapper code will be used (i.e. Squall), so this is
  not a large concern.

- This uses a clone of the real mysql.h, partially because mysql.h on OS X
  on OS X includes system headers with GCC extensions which cause ml-nlffigen
  to fail with parse errors. Additionally, the substitute mysql.h allows the
  following workaround.

- SML/NJ's code generator does not directly support 64-bit arithmetic, and
  its code generator cannot handle the C calling convention for 64-bit values
  on a 32-bit architecture. This is worked around as such:
  - mysql_data_seek(), which takes a my_ulonglong parameter, raies Fail.
  - The local mysql.h defines a typdef unsigned long my_ulonglong_returned;
    mysql_affected_rows(), mysql_insert_id(), and mysql_num_rows() return this.
    Although this is essentially an ABI mismatch, the effect (at least on x86)
    is that the upper 32 bits will be truncated. Better than nothing.

- SML/NJ's Compilation Manager will automatically invoke ml-nlffigen (via make)
  if necessary. Before using libmysqlclient.mlb with MLton, you must invoke
  'make' in the libmysqlclient directory to generate the bindings.


An implementation using MLton's native FFI should be written. It would avoid
the 64-bit incompatibilities with SML/NJ, bypass the massively inelegant need
for a local, modified mysql.h, and be significantly more efficient due to the
design of ML-NLFFI.
